# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree from Udacity

This repo will be use to record my notes for this course.

## Matplotlib and Seaborn Chapter

We start the exploration of any datasets with univariate visualizations or **visualizations of single variables**. By looking at one variable at a time we can build an intuition for how each variable is distributed before moving on to more complicated interactions between variables. When you start looking at any dataset, keep in mind **the goals of your investigation** and explore the variables that will be key to answering your research questions.


- Bar Charts are used for **Qualitative variables**
- Histograms are used for **Quantitative variables**

### What is a Tidy Data

In short, a tidy dataset is a tabular dataset where : 

 - Each variable is a column
 - Each observation is a row
 - Each type of observational unit is a table
